  * Drop obsolete RTLinux (#68 <https://github.com/ros2/realtime_support/issues/68>)
    RTLinux is obsolete, and both commercial and GPL editions were no longer
    maintained. Through the use of the real-time Linux kernel patch
    PREEMPT_RT, support for full preemption of critical sections, interrupt
    handlers, and "interrupt disable" code sequences can be supported.
